# architecture-and-design

--- Description --- 

  This is a website I built using HTML, CSS and Java Script. It has a dynamic design being built to look pleasant on the eye, natural and with the right amount of colors, animations and font.
  The project contains four html pages, a Home page, a Contact page, a About page and a Contact page. All four of them being almost entirely functional apart from the Contact Form in the Contact page,
since the Architecutre & Design firm is a fictional one so the emails or messages submitted through that form don't go through.

--- Features --- 

  The Home Page contains a background image with a transparent, slightly darkened background to keep the eyes relaxed and diminish the bright colours in the image as well as to bring out
the white colour of the text and the "Learn More" button which will be described later on in this "README" file.
  In the top-right corner we have the classic hamburger menu, however built as a sidebar not a dropdown since somtimes BootStrap can be quite stubborn so for efficiency and easy styling I went with a classic 
hamburger button built entirely from scratch that comes in from the side of the page with a slightly transparent white background in order to not break out of the dynamics of the page
and at the same time bring out the lightgrey font-color in the navigation bar buttons.
  The "Learn More" button on click, leads you to the "About Us" page where you learn everything there is to know about Morgan Design. The button's functionality was achieved using JavaScript.
  The About Page has a grid layout for a proportionate display around the centered image with a lightgrey background, and a dark text accompanied by Font-Awesome icons for design.
  The Team Page contains three images representing the active team working at Morgan Design formed of a CEO, an Architect and an Interior Designer.
  The Contact Page has a contact form where the user can send project ideas to the team.
  At the bottom of the navigation bar there are three social-media icons that take the users to the company's social-media profiles. The links redirect you in a new page facilitating 
  navigation so that the user doesn't forget where he was before clicking on the social media icon.
